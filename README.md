# QueryStream: Streamline Your Data Flow with LINQ
Tired of writing complex LINQ queries for filtering, paging, sorting and filtering your database? QueryStream is here to help! 

This lightweight C# NuGet package simplifies data access by encapsulating requests and responses into manageable objects.

QueryStream offers:

- __Effortless Query Construction__: Build robust LINQ queries with filtering, searching, sorting, paging, and aggregation using the intuitive DataQuery class.
- __Streamlined Response Handling__: Easily navigate the retrieved data through the structured DataQueryResult object.
- __Improved Code Readability__: Enhance your code by separating data access logic from your core application logic.
- __Increased Productivity__: Focus on data manipulation and analysis rather than low-level query construction.
- __Entity Framework Support__: This package works with the IQueryable interface, meaning direct interop with Entity Framework. Support for other ORMs is planned.

## Who is QueryStream for?

- Developers seeking a more intuitive and efficient way to interact with databases using LINQ.
- Teams looking to improve code readability and maintainability.
- Anyone wanting to free themselves from the complexities of writing raw SQL queries.
